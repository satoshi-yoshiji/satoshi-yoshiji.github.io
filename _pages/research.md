**Our research focus**: Our lab focuses on three main pillars:
1. Large-scale human genetics and multi-omics analysis for drug target discovery: We use genomics, proteomics, and other omics in combination with genetic epidemiology methods to understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and to identify potential drug targets.<br />
We are living in an unprecedented time of access to enormous amounts of genomics, proteomics, and omics data. For example, the UK Biobank, a leading open science biobank, currently holds more than 10 petabytes of data, expected to grow to over 40 petabytes by 2025. Although extensive training is required to fully utilize these datasets, the opportunities are enormous.
In our lab, we use genetic epidemiology methods such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), colocalization, and mediation analysis, combined with gene expression analysis at both tissue and single-cell resolution.
We have access to clinical, genetic, and omics data from 500,000 individuals in the UK Biobank, 250,000 individuals in the All of Us Research Program (a NIH-led multi-ancestry biobank), and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (through collaboration with the Broad Institute).
By integrating these methods and datasets, we aim to better understand cardiometabolic diseases, identify potential therapeutic targets, and ultimately improve clinical care.

2.Building and analyzing BioPortal: We are creating and analyzing a new multi-ancestry, multi-omics biobank of 12,500 individuals in Montreal to accelerate drug development and advance precision medicine.<br />
BioPortal is a unique research initiative by the Jewish General Hospital (JGH)/Lady Davis Institute, McGill University, and a public-private partnership, starting with Roche. This is a joint team effort, and I serve as a co-PI for BioPortal, responsible for building, navigating, and analyzing the biobank. Its mission is to generate a unique and rich biobank comprising electronic health records, baseline measurements including BIA-derived body measurements, genomics data from 12,500 individuals, proteomics data from 3,000 individuals, and deep phenotyping.
BioPortal is designed for future recall-by-genotype and recall-by-phenotype studies, making it a unique multi-omics biobank of its kind.
So far, BioPortal has secured more than 9 million CAD and has recruited over 2,000 patients within 11 months. Notably, approximately half of the participants are from previously underrepresented groups.
We will generate the data on a rolling basis and are committed to open science, with the ultimate goal of transforming clinical care.

3. Disentangling the heterogeneity of diabetes and complex diseases: We dissect the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes and complex traits to understand their distinctive biology, identify drug targets, and ultimately promote precision medicine.<br />
Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease, and both genetic and phenotypic clustering have identified multiple subtypes. Notably, these subtypes exhibit different complication profiles. For instance, a subtype with a pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction-like phenotype has an increased risk of diabetic eye disease (retinopathy), whereas subtypes with obesity-like and lipodystrophy-like characteristics have an increased risk of coronary artery disease.
These findings highlight the need for better characterization of these subtypes and the identification of their causal genes and mechanisms, which can be leveraged for drug development and potential precision medicine.
In collaboration with the Flannick lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, we are using a new Bayesian method to characterize each subtype, identify causal genes, and understand their underlying biology.
Further details will be presented at ASHG 2024.

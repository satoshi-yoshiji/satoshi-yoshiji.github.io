The laboratory of Dr. Satoshi Yoshiji in the Department of Human Genetics at McGill University has fully-funded openings: **1–2 MSc**, **1 PhD**, and **1 Post-doctoral fellow**. Our lab leverages human genetics and multi-omics to accelerate drug target discovery and precision medicine. We encourage motivated students or graduates from diverse backgrounds to apply.

The standard start date for **MSc/PhD** students is **Fall 2025 (Sept 2025)** or **Winter 2026 (Jan 2026)**, and the start date for the **post-doctoral fellow** is flexible. 

We are also looking for bioinformaticians, who can support us building and analyzing a new multi-ancestry and multi-omics biobank, BioPortal. Please contact us for further information.

## About McGill

McGill University in Montreal, Canada, consistently ranks among the top 30 universities in the **QS World University Rankings 2025**. Montreal ranks **#1 among QS Best Student Cities in North America** and **#10 globally**.

## About the Lab

Our lab investigates the biology of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other complex traits to identify new drug targets and advance precision medicine. We use large-scale human genetics, multi-omics, and genetic epidemiology/statistical approaches (GWAS, Mendelian randomization, fine-mapping, polygenic risk scores).   
Representative publications include: [Yoshiji et al. *Nature Genetics* 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-02052-7), [Su et al. *medRxiv* 2024](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.17.24315553v2), [Yoshiji et al. *Nature Metabolism* 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00742-w)

Our team currently includes one PI and three PhD students and is located in the **McGill Victor Philip Dahdaleh Institute of Genomic Medicine** on the downtown campus (740 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, Quebec H3A 2T8). We are one of the five labs in the **McGill Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Genomic Medicine**. As a growing lab, your success is our success. We are deeply committed to supporting and advancing your academic career development.

## Recruitment

Positions will be filled on a rolling basis, with the first deadline on **February 24, 2025**. We may close the call once positions are filled. Early submissions/inquiries are encouraged.

---

## Your Project

You will lead and publish projects aligned with the lab’s key research interests:

1. **Large-scale human genetics and multi-omics analysis for drug target discovery**:  
   We combine genomics, proteomics, and other omics with genetic epidemiology to understand cardiometabolic diseases and discover therapeutic targets.

2. **Building and analyzing a new biobank, BioPortal**:  
   We are creating a multi-ancestry, multi-omics biobank of 12,500 individuals (with an eventual goal of 100,000) in Montreal to advance drug development and precision medicine.

3. **Disentangling the heterogeneity of cardiometabolic diseases**:  
   Using genomics and proteomics, we dissect the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes and complex traits to identify distinct biological pathways, potential therapeutic targets, and opportunities for precision medicine.

**We are Hiring!**

We are looking for applicants with  quantitative science skills and/or research experience in relevant fields. You'll have the opportunity to grow in a supportive environment with regular meetings with the PI, the lab team, and the expanded CERC team.

If you are seeking opportunities as a PhD or MSc student, postdoctoral fellow, or bioinformatician/computational biologist, please contact me at **satoshi.yoshji [at] mcgill.ca** with the following:
1. Your CV
2. A 1(-2) page cover letter detailing how your interests and skills align with our lab’s research.

### Positions Available:

We strongly welcome candidates who have demonstrated research experience, excellent English communication skills, and a motivation for both independent and collaborative work in quantitative/computational analyses.

**Graduate Students (PhD or MSc)**:
Prospective students or those accepted to or enrolled in McGill University’s Department of Human Genetics or Quantitative Life Sciences are invited to apply. Candidates should have, or be expected to receive, a Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field (e.g., bioinformatics, computer science, AI, biology, genetics, medicine, or an equivalent qualification), and demonstrated research experience. A first-author publication is a strong plus, particularly for PhD-level applicants.

**Postdoctoral Fellows**:
Applicants should hold a Ph.D. or M.D. in a relevant field (e.g., bioinformatics, computer science, AI, biology, genetics, or medicine, or an equivalent qualification). They should have a record of peer-reviewed publications, proven research experience, and a strong motivation for both independent and collaborative work.

**Computational Biologists/Bioinformaticians**:
Candidates are expected to hold a degree or relevant experience in a related field, with complementary expertise in biostatistics and large-scale genomics. Applicants should be motivated to work on genomics and omics analyses, such as variant calling from whole genome sequencing (WGS) on a biobank scale, with strong English communication skills and a passion for collaborative research.

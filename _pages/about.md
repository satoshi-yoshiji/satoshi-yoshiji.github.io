**What we do**: Our lab leverages human genetics and multi-omics to facilitate drug target discovery for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, ultimately aiming to improve patient care.


**Our research focus**: Our lab focuses on three main pillars:
1. Large-scale human genetics and multi-omics data analysis: We use genomics, proteomics, and other omics data in combination with genetic epidemiology methods to understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases and to identify potential drug targets.
2. Building a diverse multi-omics biobank in Montreal: We are creating a biobank of more than 12,000 individuals with deep phenotyping dedicated to the study and clinical trial of cardiometabolic diseases and beyond.
3. Disentangling the heterogeneity of diabetes and complex diseases: We dissect the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes and complex traits to understand their distinctive biology, identify drug targets, and ultimately promote precision medicine.


**Who we are**: We are a group of ambitious and forward-looking researchers who enjoy science. We are members of [McGill University Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/), [McGill Genomic Medicine CERC Program](https://www.genomic-medicine-cerc.online/), and [McGill Genome Centre](https://www.mcgillgenomecentre.ca/). We work closely with the [Richards lab at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/genepi/) and the [Flannick lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.flannicklab.org/).

**What we do**: Our lab uses human genetics and multi-omics to understand the biology of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases and to identify potential drug targets for them, aiming to improve patient care.

**Our research focus**: Our lab focuses on three main pillars:
1. Large-scale human genetics and multi-omics analysis for drug target discovery: We use genomics, proteomics, and other omics in combination with genetic epidemiology methods to understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and to identify potential drug targets.

2. Building and analyzing [BioPortal](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioportal/): We are creating and analyzing a new multi-ancestry, multi-omics biobank of 12,500 individuals in Montreal to accelerate drug development and advance precision medicine.

3. Disentangling the heterogeneity of diabetes and complex diseases: We dissect the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes and complex traits to understand their distinctive biology, identify drug targets, and ultimately promote precision medicine.

• Our paper has been published in Nature Genetics!  
We explored whether plasma proteins mediate the effect of obesity on coronary artery disease risk by integrating large-scale genomics, proteomics, and other omics.  
Using two-step proteome-wide MR, domain-aware MR, epigenomics, and scRNA-seq, we identified endotrophin as a mediator and potential therapeutic target.

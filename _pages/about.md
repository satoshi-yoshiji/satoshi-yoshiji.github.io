**What we do**: Our lab uses human genetics and multi-omics to understand the biology of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases and to identify potential drug targets for them, aiming to improve patient care.

**Our research focus**: Our lab focuses on three main pillars:
1. Large-scale human genetics and multi-omics analysis for drug target discovery: We use genomics, proteomics, and other omics in combination with genetic epidemiology methods to understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and to identify potential drug targets.

2. Building and analyzing [BioPortal](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioportal/): We are creating and analyzing a new multi-ancestry, multi-omics biobank of 12,500 individuals in Montreal to accelerate drug development and advance precision medicine.

3. Disentangling the heterogeneity of diabetes and complex diseases: We dissect the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes and complex traits to understand their distinctive biology, identify drug targets, and ultimately promote precision medicine.

**Who we are**: We are a group of ambitious and forward-looking researchers who enjoy science. We are members of [McGill University Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/), [McGill Genomic Medicine CERC Program](https://www.genomic-medicine-cerc.online/), and [McGill Genome Centre](https://www.mcgillgenomecentre.ca/). <br />
The PI is also affiliated with [McGill’s Quantitative Life Sciences Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/satoshi-yoshiji/). He holds a visiting scholar position at [the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and [the Mass General Brigham Research Institute](https://cgm.massgeneral.org/).

Jan, 2025.  
• Our paper has been published in Nature Genetics!  
We integrated large-scale genomics, proteomics, and other omics to ask a question of "Does plasma proteins mediate obesity’s effect on coronary artery disease risk?"  
Using two-step proteome-wide MR, domain-aware MR, epigenomics & scRNA-seq, we prioritized endotrophin as a mediator & potential therapeutic target.

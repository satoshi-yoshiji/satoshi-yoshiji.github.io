**What we do**: Our lab leverages human genetics and multi-omics to facilitate drug target discovery for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, ultimately aiming to improve patient care.

Our lab focuses on three main pillars:
1. Analyzing large-scale human genetics and multi-omics data: We utilize proteomics to understand the underlying mechanisms of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases (cardiometabolic diseases) and to identify potential drug targets.
2. Building a diverse multi-omics biobank in Montreal: We are creating a biobank with deep phenotyping dedicated to cardiometabolic diseases and beyond.
3. Disentangling the heterogeneity of diabetes and complex diseases: We aim to understand distinctive biology, identify drug targets, and promote precision medicine through the study of these complex diseases.

**Who we are**: We are a group of ambitious and forward-looking researchers who enjoy science. We are a member of [McGill University Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/), [McGill Genomic Medicine CERC Program](https://www.genomic-medicine-cerc.online/), and [McGill Genome Centre](https://www.mcgillgenomecentre.ca/). We work closely with the [Richards lab at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/genepi/) and the [Flannick lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.flannicklab.org/).
